     <p1>Hi there! Welcome to my youtube channel's website.</p1>
     <br>

        On my youtube channel you can find two videos:
        
        <ol class="one">
            <li> Scenic Sunrise</li>
            <li>Oriental Serenity</li>
                    </ol>
        
        These videos were created for an assignment I had as part of a Video Editing course that I did in 2021. 
        <br>
        The videos had to be exactly <strong>1 minute long</strong> and had to be themed around the themes of <em>Peace</em> and <em>Sunrise </em>.
<br>
Therefore the videos were mainly marked on:
        
<ul class="one">
    <li> Video Duration</li>
            <li> Themed Video content</li>
        <li> Creation of Mood and Atmosphere</li>
            

            </ul>
